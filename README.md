# Spring-Piston Thermal Model

This project models the transient thermal response of a spring–piston–cylinder system with prescribed volume dynamics.

## Overview
- Gas volume prescribed as a function of time
- Ideal gas assumption
- Adiabatic energy balance
- Temperature response analyzed numerically

## Methods
- Governing equation derived from the first law of thermodynamics
- Volume function and its time derivative are prescribed
- Ordinary differential equation solved using explicit numerical integration (RK4)

## Files
- `spring_piston_thermal_model.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook containing the derivation, implementation, parametric studies, and results.

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
