# Spring–Piston Thermal Model

This project models the transient thermal response of a spring-piston-cylinder system with **prescribed volume dynamics**.

## Overview
- Volume is prescribed as a function of time
- Ideal gas assumption
- Energy balance solved numerically in Python
- Temperature evolution analyzed for different parameters

## Methods
- Governing equation derived from the first law of thermodynamics
- Volume function and its time derivative are prescribed
- Time integration performed using explicit numerical methods

## Files
- `Thermal Modeling of a Spring-Piston-Cylinder System with Prescribed Volume Dynamics.ipynb`  
  Main notebook containing derivation, implementation, and results.

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
